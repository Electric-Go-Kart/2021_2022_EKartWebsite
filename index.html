											<h2>Abstract</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The purpose of our project is to continue the development of last year's Electric Go-Kart. 
											Our project is closely connected with the ECE Outreach Team, with the main purpose of the 
											go-kart being educating students about engineering concepts.
											<br
											>Our core goals this year are focused on increasing the dimensions of electrical and 
											computer engineering covered in the kart. By redesigning our controls platform to enable 
											more sensors and compute power, we plan to offer a wealth of ECE application demos for 
											student enjoyment.
										</p>

										<header class="major">
											<h2>Background</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Last year's team presented us with a fully-functional electric go-kart. The kart features 
											a battery system with two electric motors, a custom chassis, and an embedded controls 
											system for data readout. Feel free to check out current pictures of the kart and it's 
											progress on the pictures page.
										</p>

										<header class="major">
											<h2>Design Goals</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>✔ Pedestrian detection system using machine learning object detection</li>
											<li>✔ Solar charging for the kart's front battery</li>
											<li>Redesign controls platform</li>
											<li>Redesign dashboard display with improved graphics</li>
										</ul>

										<header class="major">
											<h2>Project Constraints</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>Lack of mechanical engineering students means no major mechanical improvements are possible</li>
											<li>Current steering column design limits electronic steering possibilities</li>
											<li>Solid axle kart design drastically inhibits suspension options, somewhat reducing kart operating safety</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Vani Kapoor</h3>
										<p>Vani is an Electrical Engineering student graduating in Spring 2022. She is interested in Control systems 
											within renewable energy and vehicle automation. She joined the Go-Kart team to combine her passion for cars 
											and engineering while being able to learn more about different aspects of how electric vehicles work. She 
											is acting as Project Manager as well as working as a systems engineer for the control and power systems of 
											the project. After graduation, Vani wishes to pursue her interests in control system design, renewable 
											energy, and systems engineering.

										<h3>Rico Barela</h3>
										<p>Rico Barela is an Electrical Engineering student graduating in Spring of 2022. He joined the Go-Kart team because 
											he has always had a passion for working on vehicles starting at a young age, and is building his own Go-Kart 
											that is mostly focused on performance. He is interested in power engineering and mechanical concepts. His 
											main focus for the project is the power system, involving the power delivery to the Kart and possible solar 
											panel charging. After graduation he plans to get into the car industry and design/build electric motors.
										</p>

										<h3>Ryan Guidice</h3>
										<p>Ryan is a Computer Engineering student graduating in the spring of 2022. He joined the Go-Kart team because 
											it sounded like a great combination of mechanical, electrical and software principles, with ample 
											opportunity to contribute in all areas. He is working on the software and controls side of the project. His 
											interests post-graduation include VLSI design and verification, FPGA development, and embedded programming.
										</p>

										<h3>Andie Groeling</h3>
										<p>Andie Groeling is a senior at CSU studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science. She is interested in 
											embedded systems and joined the E-Kart team to explore embedded systems in modern vehicles, also bringing 
											years of robotics experience both mechanically and electrically. She is working on the controls system and 
											user interface for the kart this year. Post-graduation, Andie will be pursuing firmware engineering and 
											development and engineering of embedded systems.
